Hey, I am a Product Manager with a Fullstack Software Engineering background based in the US.

I love building and launching products that solve customer problems and bring value to the business. I like end-to-end product management, from ideation to execution. I rely on data to make product decisions and conduct user interviews to get more context on data and fill gaps. 

I am a lifelong learner. I am currently learning strategy and data product management. I like to sing, travel, and sketch. 

Thank you for checking out my profile.
