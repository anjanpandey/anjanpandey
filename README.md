Hey 👋, I am a founder of healcovery. We build AI agents (SMS+Email+Voice) that automate care coordination and collaboration for behavioral health providers.

I have a product management and software engineering background in healthcare. I love building and launching products that solve customer problems and bring value to the business. I like end-to-end product management, from ideation to execution. I rely on data to make product decisions and conduct user interviews to get more context on data and fill gaps. 

I am a lifelong learner. I like to sing, travel, and sketch. 

🙏 Thank you for checking out my profile.
