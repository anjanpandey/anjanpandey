Hey 👋, I am a founder of healcovery. At healcovery, our vision is to empower people with a personalized AI Case Manager (🤠 Casey) they can carry with them at all times, providing constant guidance and support on their path to lasting well-being.

Casey, our virtual Case Manager has a unique backstory that makes him more than just an AI agent. He is from Fort Worth, TX. Starting his journey as a cowboy, Casey faced his own struggles with addiction and mental health, having been fed data only on substance use and harmful habits. But as he began to learn more about recovery, healing, and resilience, Casey chose a new path—one of support and transformation. Now, he’s here to help others do the same.

I have a product management and software engineering background in healthcare. I love building and launching products that solve customer problems and bring value to the business. I like end-to-end product management, from ideation to execution. I rely on data to make product decisions and conduct user interviews to get more context on data and fill gaps. 

I am a lifelong learner. I like to sing, travel, and sketch. 

🙏 Thank you for checking out my profile.
